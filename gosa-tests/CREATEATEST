Creating a test is easy.

Setup:
- get Firefox and the required extensions:
 - http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/1.9.0/selenium-ide-1.9.0.xpi
 - https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/selenium-ide-php-formatters/addon-selenium-ide-php-formatters-latest.xpi

Create a test:
1) Open the Test Suite in selenium/core.suite
2) Create the test according to the Selenium IDE manuals. Read them. Even if
   they suck. Record the whole process including login/logout and make the
   test run even with the speedbar at 100% fast. Use clickAndWait() if
   needed.
3) Save the tests in the selenium/ subdirectory. Save the suite.
4) Export the testcase in PHPUnit format and name it test_FEATURENAME.php in
   the php/ subdirectory.
5) Take the php file and...
5.1) add require("class_baseGosaUserTest.php"); at the
     beginning
5.2) change the classname to test_FEATURENAME
5.3) change the base class to baseGosaUserTest
5.4) remove the codeblock regarding login and replace it with $this->login()
5.5) remove the codeblock regarding logout and replace it with $this->logout()
6) Run phpunit test_FEATURENAME.php and see if the test runs. If not, cry
   and weep silently while debugging.
7) Run the suite.
7) Commit the Selenium test and the PHP test.
